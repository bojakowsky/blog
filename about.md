Hi!

I'm Maciej Spychała, Computing Science student at Poznań University at Technology, fullstack dev.

I like cryptocurrency, infosec, privacy, opensource. When things run fast and smooth.

Mostly worked with Ruby/Java/Go/C, but I'm feeling good with learning something new.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:mac.spychala@gmail.com) anytime! (and check [github](https://github.com/maciejspychala))
